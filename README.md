# D3 Homework - Data Journalism and D3

## Background

The data set used is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

Using D3 techniques, I created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements and compares the correlation of the 2 data variables 'Obesity v Poverty'.
